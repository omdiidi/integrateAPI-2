Build a mobile first vinyl shop backend demo app that runs in Replit and is optimized for phone use.

Goal
Create a clean, modern, bright colored interface that lets a shop quickly add vinyl to a database, track in store vs online inventory, and remove items later when sold. Do not build real marketplace posting integrations today. Only store the selected marketplaces as data.

Tech stack

* Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
* Backend: Node.js + Express
* Database: SQLite (file based) using Prisma ORM
* Image handling: store the captured image as a file in the project (or base64 in DB if simpler) and save its reference on the vinyl record

Core screens and flow

1. Home screen (first screen)
   Show four large buttons in a simple grid:

* Scan
* View in store inventory
* View online inventory
* View inventory

2. Scan flow
   When user taps Scan, show a simple choice screen:

* Use camera
* No image

If Use camera

* Open device camera using an input that triggers camera on mobile (input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment")
* After the photo is taken, go to the Add vinyl form screen with the image preview shown at top

If No image

* Go to the Add vinyl form screen without an image

3. Add vinyl form screen

* Title at top: Add vinyl
* All fields are optional except Artist and Release title, which are required
* Use a clean form layout with clear labels, big touch targets, and minimal clutter

Fields to collect (exact list)
Required

* Artist (required)
* Release title (required)

Bottom action area on the form (always visible, sticky)
Include these controls exactly, with clear layout:

* In store inventory (checkbox)
* Online inventory (checkbox) with an Edit button next to it

  * Edit opens a simple modal or new screen listing marketplaces with checkboxes:

    * eBay
    * Discogs
    * Amazon
* Hold for customer (checkbox)
* Quantity (number input, default 1, minimum 1)
* Assign location (+) button

  * Tapping opens a small UI to pick or type a location label, and allow creating a new one
* Save as draft button

  * Saves record as draft in DB and returns to Home
* Print button (primary)

  * Validates required fields
  * Saves record into DB as active with all selected flags
  * Opens a simple print view and triggers browser print (window.print)
  * After printing, automatically returns to Home

Inventory views

* View inventory shows all records with simple cards (Artist, Release title, Price if present, Quantity, flags like In store, Online, Draft, Hold, Location)
* View in store inventory shows only records where inStore is true and not draft
* View online inventory shows only records where online is true and not draft
* Each list screen should allow tapping a record to open a detail screen with an Edit button and a Delete button
* Include a simple Sold action on detail screen that reduces quantity by 1, and if quantity becomes 0 it removes it from active inventory (either delete or mark as sold, but keep it simple and consistent)

Backend requirements
Prisma schema for a Vinyl table with fields to match the form, plus:

* id
* createdAt
* updatedAt
* status (draft or active)
* inStore (boolean)
* online (boolean)
* holdForCustomer (boolean)
* quantity (int)
* location (string)
* marketplaces (json string or separate table)
* imagePath (string, optional)

API endpoints

* POST /api/vinyls
* GET /api/vinyls with optional filters (all, inStore, online, status)
* GET /api/vinyls/:id
* PUT or PATCH /api/vinyls/:id
* DELETE /api/vinyls/:id
* POST /api/vinyls/:id/sold to decrement quantity

UI requirements

* Mobile first layout, responsive for desktop but designed for phone
* Bright, modern look with lots of whitespace
* Large buttons, clear typography, clean cards
* Simple navigation with a back button on secondary screens
* No complicated features beyond what is described

Demo readiness

* Seed the database with 5 sample vinyl records on first run or provide a Seed button in a hidden dev route
* Make sure it runs with one command in Replit and works in the mobile preview
* Keep code clean and easy to extend later for real marketplace integration
