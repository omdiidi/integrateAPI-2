Update the existing vinyl shop demo app so Advanced Online Settings can be opened and edited from the Online Inventory page and from the Select Marketplaces modal.

Select Marketplaces modal update

Keep the current modal UI and behavior for selecting marketplaces and tapping Done

Add a new secondary button under the marketplace checkbox list and above the Done button

Label: Advanced online settings

Tapping it opens the Advanced Online Settings page for the current vinyl (or the in progress draft if adding a new record)

Behavior rules

Advanced Online Settings must reflect the marketplaces currently selected in this modal

If no marketplaces are selected, still allow opening Advanced Online Settings

Show a small note at top: select at least one marketplace to enable per marketplace fields

Still allow editing and saving general online fields

Online Inventory page update

On the Online Inventory list page, each record card must expose two quick actions without opening the full record

Edit info

Advanced online settings

Place these actions on the right side of each record card in a compact vertical stack or a small actions row, consistent with the current clean UI

Also on each Online Inventory card

Show the marketplaces it is listed on directly on the card (right side), using small chips or a compact list

This must be read from the saved marketplaces array on that vinyl record

If none exist, show “No marketplaces” in a subtle style

Navigation and editing behavior

Tapping Edit info opens the normal edit record screen

Tapping Advanced online settings opens the Advanced Online Settings page for that record

After saving Advanced Online Settings, return the user back to the Online Inventory list and immediately reflect changes on that record card

Advanced Online Settings page requirements

Must be reachable from both entry points

Select Marketplaces modal

Online Inventory list page

Must load and save per vinyl record

Store advanced settings in the database under a JSON field (Prisma Json or a text field containing JSON) linked to the vinyl record

UI requirements

Mobile first, clean, modern, bright accents, large tap targets

Keep the current styling language consistent with the existing cards and modal

Do not build real marketplace posting integrations today, only store selections and advanced settings as data
