Add a new Network feature to the existing vinyl shop demo app.

Home screen update

Add a new tile button on the home screen labeled Network

Use the same tile style as the other buttons, mobile first, clean, bright

Tapping Network navigates to the Network section

Network section overview
Purpose

This is a shared online database of vinyl inventory across many different shops

For the demo, this is fake data stored locally in the app database, but structured as if it were a real network

Network list screen

Show a long scrollable list of network records

Insert 100 fake vinyl records as examples on first run (seed data)

Include a search bar at the top that filters by artist, release title, label, catalog number, and format

Each list row shows at minimum: Artist, Release title, price if present, and a small chip showing which shop has it

Tapping a row opens a Network item detail screen

Network item detail screen

Show the vinyl info (artist, title, key identifiers)

Show the shop that has it, including:

Store name

Phone number

Email

Include a primary button: Request

Tapping Request opens a DM page with that shop

DM page

Simple messaging UI for demo purposes

Header shows the shop name and the vinyl being requested

Show a message thread area (can be fake seeded messages)

Text input at bottom with Send button

Sending a message appends to the local thread in the database

My Network Listings

In the Network section, include a button or tab labeled My Listings

This shows items from this shop that are listed in the network

Allow adding an item from the local inventory into the network listing:

Simple select flow: choose an existing vinyl from the shop inventory and publish it to the network

Store it as a network listing tied to this shop profile

Data modeling (demo)

Create a Shop table for network shops: id, name, phone, email

Create a NetworkListing table: id, vinyl fields summary, shopId foreign key, createdAt

Seed at least 10 different shops and distribute the 100 fake records across them

Ensure search and detail views pull from NetworkListing joined with Shop

UI requirements

Keep everything phone optimized

Maintain the same modern design language as the home tiles and inventory cards

Keep flows fast, minimal taps, and easy to demo
