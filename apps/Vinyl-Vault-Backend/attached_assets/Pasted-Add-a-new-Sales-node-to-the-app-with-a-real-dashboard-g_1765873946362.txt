Add a new Sales node to the app with a real dashboard, graphs, and sales log powered by sold items. Also add a Sold items button to view all sold records. Seed fake sales and fake orders with dates.

Home and navigation

Add a new home tile labeled Sales

Sales tile routes to a new page: /sales

Backend and database

Create new tables (Prisma + migration)

SalesOrder

id

orderNumber (string)

soldAt (datetime)

channel (enum: inStore, online, network)

marketplace (string optional, ex eBay, Discogs, Amazon)

buyerName (string optional)

buyerEmail (string optional)

totalCents (int)

SalesLineItem

id

orderId (fk)

vinylId (fk nullable, keep snapshot even if vinyl changes)

artist (string)

releaseTitle (string)

quantity (int)

unitPriceCents (int)

lineTotalCents (int)

Update the existing Sold action so it also creates sales records

When a vinyl is sold, create a SalesOrder plus one SalesLineItem (or attach to an existing order if you already have that concept)

Store a snapshot of artist and releaseTitle on the line item so historical sales stay accurate

If quantity is decremented, create the line item with that quantity and correct totals

API

Add endpoints

GET /api/sales/orders (supports date range and search)

GET /api/sales/orders/:id (includes line items)

GET /api/sales/line-items (supports date range and search)

GET /api/sales/stats?range=7|30|90|all returns aggregated metrics for graphs

Ensure the Sold action endpoint calls the same create logic so the dashboard always reflects real data

Seed fake data

On first run, seed:

10 fake shops already exist for Network, keep those

60 fake orders across the last 90 days with realistic dates

Each order has 1 to 3 line items

Use realistic record titles and artists (can reuse your existing seeded inventory plus extra fake ones)

Mix channels: inStore and online, plus a few network requests converted to sales

Populate marketplace for online orders (eBay, Discogs, Amazon)

Make prices and quantities realistic, and compute totals correctly

Sales dashboard UI

Create /sales page with:

Date range selector: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, all

KPI cards:

Total revenue

Units sold

Orders count

Average order value

Graphs using real aggregated sales data:

Line chart: revenue by day (or by week when range is 90 or all)

Bar chart: top artists by revenue

Pie chart: sales by channel (inStore vs online vs network)

Sales log preview (most recent 10 line items)

Sales log page and Sold items button

Add a prominent Sold items button on the Sales dashboard

Routes to /sales/sold-items

/sales/sold-items page

Full list of SalesLineItems with:

Date

Artist

Release title

Quantity

Price

Channel and marketplace if applicable

Order number

Search bar filters by artist, title, order number

Tap a row to open order detail

Order detail page

/sales/orders/:id

Show order header info (date, channel, marketplace, totals)

Show line items list

UI requirements

Mobile first, clean, same design language as the rest of the app

Charts should be responsive and readable on phone

All dashboard numbers and charts must be computed from SalesOrder and SalesLineItem data, not hardcoded
